Mostly an intro into python code structure and syntax

Best Practice - New Line at the end of file 

You can create a new line by using the "\n"

Strings - You can think of strings as a string of connected characters 

String Concatenation with "+" symbol 

Functions 
Print Function - This prints text 
Input Function - This allows you to prompt for a response 
len Function (Python String Length) - This allows you to get the length of a string 

Variables 
Lets you store values in containers for later use 

A point of note - Python is unable to concantenate both integer to string so I encountered an error while trying to print the number of characters in a user's name 
The fix was to transform the integer to a string using the str function - This is on line 19
